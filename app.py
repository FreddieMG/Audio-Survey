    ### Welcome to the Audio Perception Experiment

    You are invited to participate in an experiment examining the effect of audio perturbations and transformations on human perception and understanding.

    **Overview of the Study:**
    - In the first part, we will play speech recordings for you. After hearing the audio sample, you will transcribe the audio in the text box. Please listen to the audio once and transcribe to the best of your abilities.
    - In the second part, we will display a larger variety of audio samples, all transformed using several different methods. For each audio sample, you will rate the audio for pleasantness and clarity.
    - After finishing each section, click on the "Submit and Commit" button to save your results.

    **Details:**
    - The experiment will take approximately 40 minutes.
    - As a token of appreciation, you will receive a payment of 50 â‚ª.

    **Participation Rights:**
    - You may stop participating at any time by closing this window. However, please note that closing the window will prevent your data from being saved, and you will not receive the payment.

    Thank you for your cooperation!
